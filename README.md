# Project Title: Interactive Superstore Sales Dashboard
## Project Objective
To design and implement a comprehensive, interactive sales dashboard that provides key stakeholders with real-time, actionable insights into the Superstore's sales performance, profitability, and operational efficiency across different regions, categories, and customer segments to enable data-driven decision-making to optimize strategy and drive business growth.
## Dataset Used
https://github.com/kirti2222/Excel-Data-Analysis-Dashboard-/blob/main/Superstore%20Dataset.xlsx
## Project Questions
1.	What is the overall trend in sales and profit from 2014 to 2017? Is the growth sustainable or is it slowing down?
2.	Which category (Furniture, Office Supplies, or Technology) is the most profitable overall, and how has the profit trend for each category changed from year to year?
3.	Which states generate the highest revenue (as highlighted by the map)? Conversely, which states are underperforming and require focused marketing effort?
4.	What is the average profit generated by the top customers (e.g., Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch) compared to the rest of the customer base? What is the strategy for retaining these top customers?
5.	Why are categories like Fasteners, Labels, and Envelopes at the bottom? Are they priced correctly, or should the company stop stocking them?
## Project Process
1. Detremine the purpose of the dashboard. For example: Tracking sales performance, identifying top products, customers etc.
2. Identify the Key Performance Indicators such as Sales by Category, Profit Over Time, Sales by State, Customer Count by Year, Top Customers making profits and Monthly Sales Trends.
3. Import the raw sales data into excel
4. Ensure Data Consistency. For Example: Fprmatting dates etc.
5. Check for duplicates or errors
6. Structure the data into excel table for easier analysis.
7. Created the pivot tables for supporting calculations
8. Set up the Dashboard sheet with a clean, professional layout (e.g., remove gridlines, apply a background color).
9. Copy and paste the created charts and tables onto the Dashboard sheet
10. Arrange the elements logically, usually putting the most critical information at the top.
11.  Add a title and a color scheme to unify the design.
12.  Insert Slicers for Categories and Timelines for Years.
13. Connect each Slicer/Timeline to all relevant Pivot Tables/Charts so that selecting a filter dynamically updates the entire dashboard. 
14. Test all filters, charts, and calculations to ensure accuracy and functionality.
15. Finalize formatting and labeling for clarity.
16. Document the data source and refresh process.

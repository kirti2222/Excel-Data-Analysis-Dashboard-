# Project Title: Interactive Superstore Sales Dashboard
## Project Objective
To design and implement a comprehensive, interactive sales dashboard that provides key stakeholders with real-time, actionable insights into the Superstore's sales performance, profitability, and operational efficiency across different regions, categories, and customer segments to enable data-driven decision-making to optimize strategy and drive business growth.
## Dataset Used
https://github.com/kirti2222/Excel-Data-Analysis-Dashboard-/blob/main/Superstore%20Dataset.xlsx
## Project Questions
1.	What is the overall trend in sales and profit from 2014 to 2017? Is the growth sustainable or is it slowing down?
2.	Which category (Furniture, Office Supplies, or Technology) is the most profitable overall, and how has the profit trend for each category changed from year to year?
3.	Which states generate the highest revenue (as highlighted by the map)? Conversely, which states are underperforming and require focused marketing effort?
4.	What is the average profit generated by the top customers (e.g., Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch) compared to the rest of the customer base? What is the strategy for retaining these top customers?
5.	Why are categories like Fasteners, Labels, and Envelopes at the bottom? Are they priced correctly, or should the company stop stocking them?
## Project Process
1. Detremine the purpose of the dashboard. For example: Tracking sales performance, identifying top products, customers etc.
2. Identify the Key Performance Indicators such as Sales by Category, Profit Over Time, Sales by State, Customer Count by Year, Top Customers making profits and Monthly Sales Trends.
3. Import the raw sales data into excel
4. Ensure Data Consistency. For Example: Fprmatting dates etc.
5. Check for duplicates or errors
6. Structure the data into excel table for easier analysis.
7. Created the pivot tables for supporting calculations
8. Set up the Dashboard sheet with a clean, professional layout (e.g., remove gridlines, apply a background color).
9. Copy and paste the created charts and tables onto the Dashboard sheet
10. Arrange the elements logically, usually putting the most critical information at the top.
11.  Add a title and a color scheme to unify the design.
12.  Insert Slicers for Categories and Timelines for Years.
13. Connect each Slicer/Timeline to all relevant Pivot Tables/Charts so that selecting a filter dynamically updates the entire dashboard. 
14. Test all filters, charts, and calculations to ensure accuracy and functionality.
15. Finalize formatting and labeling for clarity.
16. Document the data source and refresh process.
## Project Insights
1. The overall trend shows consistent and remarkable growth in both sales and profit from 2014 to 2017. Sales and profit generally increased year-over-year, demonstrating the business's ability to expand its market presence and financial performance.
2. The category of technology is the most profitable overall followed by office supplies and furnitrue and shows the upward growth from 2014 to 2017.
3. The states that generate the highest revenue are indicated by the darkest shades of blue on the map. California and New York are the highest revenue generating hubs and the states that generates the lowest revenue are indicated by lihght blue on the map.Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, daho, Utah, New Mexico, Mississippi, Alabama are the lowest revenue generating states. These states need focussed marketing efforts to increase their revenue.
4. The average profit generated by the Top 5 customers is around 50% and these 50% generated profits are from Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch. Since the data clearly identifies their exceptional profit contribution, they should be moved to a VIP tier. This involves assigning a dedicated, highly trained account manager to handle all their needs and strengthen the personal relationship and make them feel uniquely valued for maintaining the long-term relationship with the superstore's overall growth and profits.
5. The categories Fasteners, Labels, and Envelopes are at the bottom of the "Sales By Category" chart because they represent the lowest total sales revenue among all listed categories in the dashboard's time frame (2014-2017). The superstore should focus on marketing these products to generate more sales from these products and also they should keep discounts on these products for more sales and revenue generations from these products.

## Final Conclusion
The conclusion of this project is that the company is currently on a trajectory of moderate growth driven almost entirely by the Technology category, while its core historical lines, Furniture and Office Supplies, are underperforming and require immediate intervention. Specifically, the company should urgently investigate the profit decline in these two segments to prevent the overall positive trend, currently sustained by Technology, from stalling. Furthermore, a strategic opportunity exists to maximize returns from the most valuable customers, particularly Tamara Chand, Raymond Buch, and Sanjit Chand, whose loyalty and purchasing power are critical to maintain profitability. Finally, all resource planning should be optimized to fully capitalize on the pronounced seasonal peak in the fourth quarter, ensuring inventory and staffing align with this annual surge in demand.
